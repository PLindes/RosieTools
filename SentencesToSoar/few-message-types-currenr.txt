#Message-type:  failed-parse  [knows all of the words, but can’t parse the sentence.]
#Example: Green the store block.
Green the store block.
(S9 	^message-type failed-parse)

#Message-type:  yes   
#Construction *-yes-T 
#Examples: yes. yeah. ok. 
Yes.
(S9 ^message-type yes)

#Message-type:  no
#Construction *-no-T
#Examples: no. nope.
No.
(S9 ^message-type no)

#Message-type: finished
#Construction *-finished-T
#Examples: done. finished.
Finished.
(S9 ^message-type finished)


#Message type:  adjective-definition 
#Construction: *-ADJ-is-DP-T 
#       If already defined (green is known to be a color), this becomes ^message-type ignore
#Examples: Purple is a color. Triangle is a shape. Large is a size.
Purple is a color.

(@c1 ^name color)       


#Message type:  object-description 
#Construction: *-DP-is-ADJ/DP/PP-T
#Examples: The ball is red. The ball is a sphere. The ball is in the pantry. The ball is to the right of the red sphere.

The sphere is green.
(S9 	^arg1 <obj-sphere>    # was indicated-object

(@g1 ^name green1)

       
The red triangle is on the big green block.
(S9 	^ arg1 <obj-red-triangle>    # was indicated-object
       ^message-type object-description
       	^relation S10)
(S10  	^arg2 <obj-big-green>
       ^id @p1)
(@p1 ^name on1)
       
The red triangle.
(S9 	^arg1 <obj-red-triangle>
       ^message-type object-description)
       
The red triangle on the large green block.
(S9 	^arg1 <obj-red-triangle> 
       ^message-type object-description)
       
The red one.  
# with the context of previous object partial description – Store the block – Which one?
